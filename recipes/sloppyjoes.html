            Heat a large skillet over medium heat.

            bell pepper; continue to cook until vegetables
            have softened and beef is cooked through,
            3 to 5 more minutes.

        <li>
            Stir in ketchup, brown sugar, mustard, and

            Reduce heat to low and simmer for 20 to 30
            minutes.
        </li>

        <li>Divide meat mixture evenly among hamburger buns.</li>
