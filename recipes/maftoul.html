    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> 
        Maftoul is a traditional Palestinian dish made 
        from pearl-shaped wheat, often compared to couscous. 
        It’s typically prepared with chickpeas, onions, 
        garlic, and a blend of aromatic spices. However, 
        Maftoul is a versatile dish—while the classic 
        version uses chicken broth, it can easily be made 
        vegetarian by substituting with a rich tomato broth.
    </p>

    <p>
        You can enjoy Maftoul in its simplest form or get 
        creative by adding your own twist with additional 
        vegetables or seasonings. Whether you choose to 
        make it from scratch or buy it premade from the store, 
        this dish is a flavorful, hearty meal that’s sure 
        to satisfy.
