    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

        <li>1 ½ cups chicken stock, divided</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon finely chopped onion</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, finely chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon lemon pepper seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch ground allspice</li>

        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Place 1 tablespoon of chicken stock in a saucepan
            over medium-low heat, and cook and stir the onion
            and garlic in the broth until they are softened,
            about 3 minutes. Pour in the rest of the broth and
            1/2 cup of milk, and whisk in the salt, black pepper,
            parsley, lemon pepper seasoning, allspice, and paprika.
            Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and allow to
            simmer for 1 to 2 minutes.
        </li>

        <li>
            Whisk together the remaining milk and the flour until
            smooth, and whisk the milk mixture into the hot stock
            mixture. Keep whisking continuously to avoid lumps
            until the soup comes almost to a boil and thickens
        </li>
